# Verse Vault: Exploring Book Trends
Analyzing a book database using SQL and Excel to uncover trends in book sales, ratings, genres, and authors.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze a book database, extracting actionable insights on total sales, book ratings, publication trends, and popular genres/authors using SQL. The insights were visualized through an interactive Excel dashboard for a comprehensive overview of the data.

## Technology Used
- **Database Management System**: MySQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE, Microsoft Excel
- **Language**: SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves creating and analyzing a custom database of books, authors, and genres. The database was built from scratch using randomly generated data for 37 books spanning 13 authors and 10 genres. Although the data is fictional, the project showcases SQL's ability to handle complex queries and Excel's capabilities for creating intuitive visualizations.

SQL queries were used to uncover insights, which were then exported to Excel for visualization. A dashboard was built to provide a consolidated view of the findings, with dynamic filters for enhanced interactivity.

## Key SQL Insights

### Author Analysis
- **Top Authors by Book Count**: Identified the authors with the highest number of books published.
- **Best-Selling Authors**: Ranked authors based on their total book sales.

### Genre Trends
- **Top Genres by Popularity**: Highlighted the genres with the highest number of books.
- **Highest Grossing Genre**: Determined the genre with the highest total sales.

### Sales Analysis
- **Top-Selling Books**: Extracted the books with the highest revenue.
- **Yearly Trends**: Analyzed total book sales by year to identify peak publishing periods.

### Ratings Analysis
- **Top Rated Books**: Identified books with the highest average ratings.
- **Average Rating by Genre**: Calculated the average ratings of books across different genres.

### Overall Trends
- **Publishing Timelines**: Extracted the number of books published over time to analyze trends between 1938 and 2009.

## Excel Dashboard Insights
Using the insights derived from SQL, the Excel dashboard was built to visualize key metrics and trends.

- **Slicers**: Filter the data by authors and genres.

## Summary
This project demonstrates how SQL and Excel can work together to analyze and visualize trends from a structured database. SQL was used to extract key insights related to sales, ratings, and publishing trends, while Excel was used to create a dynamic dashboard for visualizing these insights. This project highlights the value of combining SQL analysis and Excel dashboards to uncover patterns and present data effectively.
